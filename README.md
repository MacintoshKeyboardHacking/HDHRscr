scripts to automate HDHomeRun DVR operations  
  
  
I love HDHR network tuners!  Fast, quick, easy... you can stream live TV even on an iPad 1!  
I had their DVR service for awhile, it definitely performed as advertised but too many limitations for my needs.  
These scripts were ones I used to automatically poll my unit and extract all the recordings while naming them apropriately.  The script then deletes all but the 5 most recent episodes of each show because HDHR's DVR doesn't do that?!!!  
These scripts make it easy to create a large collection of content stored on a NAS SMB/WWW share and watch it from any device; if on mobile I recommend the awesome 'OwlFiles' app (no affiliation, just a great media player! and the only one I've found with WebDAV)  
  
These days I've moved most of my DVR usage over to a Tablo 4th gen, on account of the free service and additional streaming channels.  Their app works perfectly on my modern Apple TV and iPad/iPhone devices, but I keep HDHR around for older devices and computer support.  I also use it with TVHeadend software on a Raspberry Pi4 for my limited remote viewing needs... that setup gives hardware h264 encoding which makes cellular playback easy.
